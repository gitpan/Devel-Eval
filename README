NAME
    Devel::Eval - Allows you to debug string evals

SYNOPSIS
      use Devel::Eval 'dval';
      
  dval "print 'Hello World!';";

DESCRIPTION
    In the Perl debugger, code created via a string eval is effectively
    invisible. You can run it, but the debugger will not be able to display
    the code as it runs.

    For modules that make heavy use of code generation, this can make
    debugging almost impossible.

    Devel::Eval provides an alternative to string eval that will do a
    string-eval equivalent, except that it will run the code via a temp
    file.

    Because the eval is being done though a physical file, the debugger will
    be able to see this code and you can happily debug your generated code
    as you do all the rest of your code.

FUNCTIONS
  dval
    The "dval" function takes a single parameter that should be the string
    you want to eval, and executes it.

    Because this is intended for code generation testing, your code is
    expected to be safe to run via a 'require' (that is, it should return
    true).
